# Taxi-Fare-Price-Prediction-Using-Pyspark  
This project demonstrates how to build a taxi fare prediction model using PySpark.  
The goal is to predict the fare amount for a given taxi ride based on features such as the distance traveled, pickup and drop-off locations, and other relevant information.

## Prerequisites  
* Python 3.6+
* Matplotlib  
* PySpark  
* Google Colab (recommended for ease of use)
